# Master_Project-Mouth State Detection
Topic: Open/Closed Mouth State Detection for Robot-Assisted Drinking Task   

Methods:   
Detect open or closed mouth state by using Haar Cascade Classifer, assess readiness to drink and transmit the corresponding messags to the robot arm, implement in ROS system  

Optimization: apply Facial Landmark Detection(Dlib) and MedianFlow tracking algorithm  

Process Flow:
